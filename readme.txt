Hello, welcome to my project - https://aprilhelsley.github.io/tea-cozy/
I struggled a bit with how to structure the containers, and if a container, could have a container in it.  I come from table coding, many years ago and it took me some time to get these items close to right.  Please provide me any suggestions as I know I didn't optimize the way the css is and could use some help on what is necessary and what is't.

Thanks!

April
